                        8 MaxxFortune’s privacy principles
                      </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      MaxxFortune’s products and services run on trust. At MaxxFortune, we value, protect, and defend privacy. We believe in transparency so that people and organizations can control their data and have meaningful choices in how it's used. We empower and defend the privacy choices of every person who uses our products and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      MaxxFortune’s approach to privacy is built on the following five principles:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      8.1 Control: Putting you, the customer, in control of your data and your privacy. Your data is your asset, and you can access, modify, or delete it at any time. MaxxFortune will not use your data without your agreement, and when we have your agreement, we use your data to provide only the services you have chosen. Your control over your data is reinforced by MaxxFortune's compliance with broadly applicable privacy laws and privacy standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      8.2 Transparency: Being transparent about data collection and use so that everyone can make informed decisions. We only process your data based on your agreement and in accordance with the strict policies and procedures that we've contractually agreed to. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      8.3 Security: Protecting the data that's entrusted to MaxxFortune by using strong security and encryption. Our encryption protocols erect barriers against unauthorized access to the data, including two or more independent encryption layers to protect against compromises of any one layer. All MaxxFortune-managed encryption keys are properly secured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      8.4 Strong legal protections: Respecting local privacy laws and fighting for legal protection of privacy as a fundamental human right. MaxxFortune defends your data through clearly defined and well-established response policies and processes, strong contractual commitments, and if necessary, the courts. We believe all government requests for your data should be directed to you. We don’t give any government direct or unfettered access to customer data. We will not disclose data to a government or law enforcement agency, except as you direct or where required by law. MaxxFortune scrutinizes all government demands to ensure they're legally valid and appropriate. Moreover, we'll direct the requesting party to seek the data directly from you. Our contractual commitments to our merchants and end users include defending your data, which builds on our existing protections. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      8.5 Benefits to you: When MaxxFortune does collect data, it's used to benefit you, and the customer, and to make your experiences better. For example:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Troubleshooting: Troubleshooting for preventing, detecting, and repairing problems affecting the services.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Feature improvement: Ongoing improvement of features including increasing reliability and protection of services and data.
                        </li>
